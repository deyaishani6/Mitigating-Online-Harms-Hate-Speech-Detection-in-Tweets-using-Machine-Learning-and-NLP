In this study, the pressing need for effective hate speech detection in online communication is emphasized. While early approaches relied on lexicon-based methods, recent advancements in machine learning and NLP techniques have greatly improved detection capabilities. The study employs a training dataset of 32,000 labeled tweets, utilizing techniques such as word cloud visualization, feature engineering, and TF-IDF vectorization. To address data imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied.

Four models, including Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, are evaluated using the F1 score metric. The Random Forest Classifier emerges as the most effective after hyperparameter tuning. Challenges persist, especially in cases where the meaning of a sentence contradicts its literal words, indicating the need for more advanced text analytics.

The research underscores the significance of preprocessing steps, dataset integrity, and the responsible use of technology in combating hate speech. It advocates for further exploration of sentiment analysis and context modeling, and emphasizes the importance of multilingual adaptation. The study contributes to fostering a safer online environment, highlighting the evolving landscape of hate speech detection and the need for continual advancements in this critical area
